# Simple React App
![alt tag](http://res.cloudinary.com/abacus/image/upload/v1473018221/simpleReactApp_uwsd93.png)

This is just experimental coding for me to learn and practice basic coding/file structures and functionality of react.js.

- Example folder contains the older versions of the code.
- I will delete codes inside the files in src in the root, and rewrite the code for practice.

## Main points to practice
- rewrite the code for the React component ES6 classes (React.Component as opposed to React.createClass)
- props and state
- event handlers
- processing input(search bar)
- import & use lodash for throttling search input
- processing form
- setting state
- call back functions
- write functional stateless component for contact.

## Updates
- Basic styling added using materialize-css and animate.css
- Simple Express Server added.
- Installed react-fetch

## How to start the dev server
Just type below in your terminal:
```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
```

## Deployment (in Heroku)
Please check the app (my coding practice) in the below link.
