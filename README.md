# Simple React Contact List
This is just a kata for me to learn and practice basic coding/file structures and functionality of react.js.

- Example folder contains the finished code.
- I will delete codes inside the files in src in the root, and rewrite the code for practice.

## Main points to practice
- rewrite the code for the React component ES6 classes (React.Component as opposed to React.createClass)
- props and state
- event handlers
- processing form
- setting state
- write functional stateless component for contact.

# How to start the server
Just type below in your terminal:
```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
```
